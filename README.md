# 1257 Robot Code
This project is meant to be 1257's code, but upgraded with Path Planner and Advantage Kit.
The elevator subsystem moves the shaft necessary for the robot to pick up and manipulate objects
on the playing field. The elevator subsystem required PID constants and a setVoltage command to control
its movement speed and location, as well as having constants at its limits of range. The elevator also 
had to send information to the SmartDashboard, have a braking option, have encoders to track its location,
a setpoint, a method to update the inputs received, deadzones, and variables related to its operation.
